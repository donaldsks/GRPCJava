grpc Examples
==============================================

In order to run the examples simply execute one of the gradle tasks `routeGuideServer` or
`routeGuideClient`.

Assuming you are in the grpc-java root folder you would first start the server by running

```
$ ./gradlew :grpc-examples:routeGuideServer
```

and in a different terminal window then run the client by typing

```
$ ./gradlew :grpc-examples:routeGuideClient
```

That's it!
